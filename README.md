# VBA-challenge
In the “Multiple_year_stock_data” worksheet, I used the Visual basic tool under the Developer tab in excel to code and find the following: Ticker, yearly change, percentage change, and Total Stock Volume.
I did first of all go back into zoom cloud recordings to check steps taken to loop through files, did watch multiple videos on YouTube to understand to solve for the assignment with these factors. Did search for formulars and codes on google to solve for the assignment.
Did find help on google on how to code for greatest percentage increase and decrease in ticker with value attached. Did final code for greatest total volume in ticker with value.
