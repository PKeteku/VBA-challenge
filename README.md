# VBA-challenge
In the “Multiple_year_stock_data” worksheet, I used the Visual basic tool under the Developer tab in excel to code and find the following: Ticker, yearly change, percentage change, and Total Stock Volume.
I did first of all go back into zoom cloud recordings to steps taken to loop through files, did watch multiple videos on YouTube to understand to solve for the assignment with these factors. Did search for formulars and codes on google to solve for the assignment.
